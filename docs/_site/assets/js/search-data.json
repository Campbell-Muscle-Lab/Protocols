Here are the hosted documents: . | Animals | Biochemistry | CARP Blood Processing Protocol | Carotid Artery and LV Catheterization | Chemical Inventory | Cleaning Glassware | DNA and RNA Protocols | Histology | Human Cardiac Sample Collection: In 2008, we initiated a collaboration with a cardiothoracic surgeon to procure myocardium from patients and organ donors. The program took off and our lab has now invested ~100,000 hours (24/7 call for 15 years) building a biobank that contains &gt;10,000 samples from 400 patients. We share these samples with investigators from ~30 institutions around the world and use them in nearly all of our own experiments. Please email Ken Campbell, PhD to inquire about samples. | MS518 -80°C Freezer | Manuals | Mechanics | Milli - Q System | Solutions | Statistics | pH Meter Use and Maintenance | . ",
