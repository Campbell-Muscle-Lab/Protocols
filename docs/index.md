## Protocols

This is the home page for Campbell Muscle Lab protocols, equipment manuals, SOPs, and how-to's.


Here are the hosted documents:

+ [Human Cardiac Sample Collection](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/Protocols/tree/main/Human_Cardiac_Sample_Collection): In 2008, we initiated a collaboration with a cardiothoracic surgeon to procure myocardium from patients and organ donors. The program took off and our lab has now invested ~100,000 hours (24/7 call for 15 years) building a biobank that contains >10,000 samples from 400 patients. We share these samples with investigators from ~30 institutions around the world and use them in nearly all of our own experiments. Please email [Ken Campbell, PhD](mailto:k.s.campbell@uky.edu) to inquire about samples.
